// Board.cc (interface)
// Module: Board
// Description:
//   Represents the Watopoly game board containing 40 squares.
//   This class holds a vector of polymorphic Square* objects,
//   constructed and ordered according to Watopoly layout.
//
//   Board is purely a data container. It does NOT:
//     - Know about players
//     - Move players
//     - Execute game logic
//
//   All player interaction and movement is handled externally,
//   typically by GameController. This follows the CS246 principle
//   of separating data (Board) from control (GameController).
//
//   Design Patterns:
//     - Composite Pattern: Board holds a homogeneous collection of
//       polymorphic Square subclasses.
//     - Mediator Pattern: GameController drives interaction between
//       Board, Square, and Player.
