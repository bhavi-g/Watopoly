// Academic-Building-impl.cc (implementation)
// Module: AcademicBuilding
// Description:
//   Implements behavior for academic buildings on the board.
//   AcademicBuildings are ownable and upgradable (0â€“5 improvements).
//   Rent calculation is affected by improvements and monopoly ownership.
//
//   Logic for rent or improvement purchase will be delegated to GameController.
