// Player.cc (interface)
// Module: Player
// Description:
//   Represents a human-controlled player in the game of Watopoly.
//   Each player has a unique token, a name, a money balance, and a collection
//   of buildings they currently own (tracked by building name).
//
//   This module is intentionally decoupled from Building to avoid circular
//   dependencies. Ownership is represented via building name strings.
//
// Related Modules:
//   - GameController (invokes player pay/receive, manages turns and interactions)
//   - Building (calls getToken() to check ownership)
//   - Square (players are passed to onLand())
